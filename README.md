# Assignment 1

The first assignment is an appetizer assignment.  

In this assignment you have to work with the presidents *database*
> This is implemented as JSON files in the *data* directory.

You should all be familiar with this from the Database course.

## TODO

1. First make sure to install the needed packages (only [jest](https://jestjs.io/)), with the following command
    - `npm install`
2. Implement the functions in `assignment.js`
3. Build and test `assignment.js`
    - Build: `node assignment.js` or `npm run build`
    - Test: `npm run test`
4. Push to GitHub, there is already a GitHub Action defined in the repository, that will automatically test your code.

## Rules

1. Do not just return the expected result, actually implement the functions in a functional programming way (no loops)
2. Do not modify the data
3. Do not modify the tests
4. All test must be green
5. All assignments will be verified manually to be correct
